Most of the code inside this `network/` folder,
is from the `Chatterino` project (which you will
find [here](https://github.com/chatterino/chatterino2))

However, there were some changes made.

This file is just, because
I don't want to put something like `Borrowed from ...` into every
source/header file.

The specific directory from the `Chatterino` project, where
most code is from, is [here](https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/tree/master/src/common).
(mostly files beginning with `Network...`)
