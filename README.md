# EuleHakenBot - A Twitch Chatbot as a GUI Application in C++

This project is supposed to become a GUI Application, from which you will be able to connect to Twitchs
IRC servers and there, connect your own Twitch Chatbot.

Maybe, in the future, I will make it, so you will be able to connect to other IRC servers aswell.
